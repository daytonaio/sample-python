## Things to try

Once you have this sample opened, you'll be able to work with it like you would locally.

Some things to try:

1. **Edit:**
   - Open `app.py`
   - Try adding some code and check out the language features.
   - Make a spelling mistake and notice it is detected. The [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) extension was automatically installed because it is referenced in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
   - Also notice that utilities like `pylint` and the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension are installed. Tools are installed in the `mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/python` image and Dev Container settings and metadata are automatically picked up from [image labels](https://containers.dev/implementors/reference/#labels).


2. **Terminal:** 
    - Press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> to open a terminal window.
    - Type `python -m flask run --port 5000 --no-debugger --no-reload` to run the app.
         - The terminal will say your app is `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Click on the link in the terminal to view your app running in the browser.
    - Notice that the Python extension is already installed in the container since the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` lists `"ms-python.python"` as an extension to install automatically when the container is created.
    
      > **Tip:** If you use this container outside of VS Code via `docker run` with `-p 5000`, you may need to append `--host 0.0.0.0` to the command above. The `-p` option "publishes" the port rather than forwarding it. It therefore will not work if the application only listens to localhost. The `forwardPorts` property in `devcontainer.json` does not have this limitation, but you can use `appPort` property instead if you want to mirror the `docker run` behavior.

3. **Build, Run, and Debug:**
   - Open `app.py`
   - Add a breakpoint (e.g. on line 9).
   - Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to launch the app in the container.
   - Once the breakpoint is hit, try hovering over variables (e.g. the app variable on line 7), examining locals, and more.
   - Continue (<kbd>F5</kbd>). You can connect to the server in the container by either: 
      - Clicking on `Open in Browser` in the notification telling you: `Your service running on port 5000 is available`.
      - Clicking the globe icon in the 'Ports' view. The 'Ports' view gives you an organized table of your forwarded ports, and you can access it with the command **Ports: Focus on Ports View**.
   - Notice port 5000 in the 'Ports' view is labeled "Hello Remote World." In `devcontainer.json`, you can set `"portsAttributes"`, such as a label for your forwarded ports and the action to be taken when the port is autoforwarded.
   
   > **Note:** In Dev Containers, you can access your app at `http://localhost:5000` in a local browser. But in a browser-based Codespace, you must click the link from the notification or the `Ports` view so that the service handles port forwarding in the browser and generates the correct URL.

4. **Rebuild or update your container**

   You may want to make changes to your container, such as installing a different version of a software or forwarding a new port. You'll rebuild your container for your changes to take effect. 

   **Open browser automatically:** As an example change, let's update the `portsAttributes` in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file to open a browser when our port is automatically forwarded.
   
   - Open the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.
   - Modify the `"onAutoForward"` attribute in your `portsAttributes` from `"notify"` to `"openBrowser"`.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.  

5. **Install Node.js using a Dev Container Feature:**
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Configure Container Features...** or **Codespaces: Configure Container Features...** command.
   - Type "node" in the text box at the top.
   - Check the check box next to "Node.js (via nvm) and yarn" (published by devcontainers) 
   - Click OK
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Rebuild Container** or **Codespaces: Rebuild Container** command so the modifications are picked up.
